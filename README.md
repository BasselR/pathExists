# pathExists
This C program will take in an array that represents a 2D matrix populated with either a 0 or a 1. 

Given 2 ordered pairs of coordinates, it will tell you whether or not those points can be connected by a path of zeroes.

Some notes:

A sample main function has been provided. You can change the sample matrix (A) and the number of rows and columns accordingly (n amd m).

The 2D matrix is represented in a 1D array, stored row-wise.

The program will tell you whether or not a path of zeroes exist between the given points, but those points must be zeroes themselves for the path to be considered.
